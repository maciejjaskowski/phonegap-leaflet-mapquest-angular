Don't forget to:
* install phonegap (npm install -g phonegap)
* install ripple (git clone incubator-ripple 0.9.19; patch with patch.patch included in this repo)
* install or update Android SDK to version >= 19

then you can run:
* incubator-ripple/bin/ripple emulate

and after each change to files in www/ run ./deploy-android.sh to have things deployed

You need to run once 'phonegap build android'
