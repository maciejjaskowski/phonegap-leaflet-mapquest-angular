Don't forget to:
* install phonegap (npm install -g phonegap)
* install or update Android SDK to version >= 19
* install ripple: 
git clone incubator-ripple 0.9.19; 
copy patch.patch from this repo to incubator-ripple/
cd incubator-ripple/
patch -p1 < patch.patch
sudo ./configure
jake

Then you can run
cd my-phonegap-app
incubator-ripple/bin/ripple emulate

and after each change to files in www/ run ./deploy-android.sh to have things deployed

You need to run once 'phonegap build android'
